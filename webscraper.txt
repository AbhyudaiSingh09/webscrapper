This is a project to scrape data from the web and store the results in a text
file and the SQLite database.

The website https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers lists extensive finance
data. You have to write Python scripts/programs to collect the current prices for the following commodities: Crude Oil, Gold and Silver. Your program
should store the commodity name and its corresponding price in a text file
called commodity_prices.txt.

In addition to the commodity_prices.txt file, the data should also be stored in an SQLite database called CommodityDatabase in the directory that your
Jupyter Notebook code will be executed from. The CommodityDatabase
should have a table called CommodityTable that contains the following
columns and types:
Ticker TEXT
Price REAL
Every execution of your program should create a new commodity_prices.txt
and CommodityDatabase.db file in the directory (delete any existing files that
you will create) that your Python script is located and run.
